            <p id="about-me-first-p">I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for coding, absorbing new skills, and collaborating with other
              people. I'm looking to join an experienced and talented engineering team focused on challenging, meaningful,
              and interesting projects that I can contribute to while also learning and growing as a developer.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>I previously worked at an e-commerce startup from the ground floor. I started as a Content Writer and transitioned
              into a management role, heading the written content department as Lead Editor. I was also responsible for general
              SEO maintenance including best on-page practices and outreach for off-page SEO.

        </div>

        <div class="row">

          <div class="col-md-12">

            <p>As a means to facilitate content creation, I taught myself basic HTML and CSS to code and style articles for
              the company's website. I soon became fascinated with the entire coding process from developing the original
              idea to the final working product. I learned to embrace the rollercoaster of coding. Working in this environment,
              I began to understand the painful hours spent searching for the best solutions as well as the euphoria of publishing
              a finished page I could be proud of. It was clear to me that my career path should involve coding, and enrolling
              in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was the first step to achieve my goal.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>I bring to any endeavor complete and focused dedication, the ability to work with others as part of a team, and
              a flexible mindset for achieving the success of any project.
