              <p>I'm a junior full stack web developer with a passion for coding, absorbing new skills, and collaborating with
                other people. I'm looking to join an experienced and talented engineering team focused on challenging, meaningful,
                and interesting projects that I can contribute to while also learning and growing as a developer.
              </p>

              <br>

              <p>I previously worked at an e-commerce startup from the ground floor. I started as a Content Writer and transitioned
                into a management role, heading the written content department as Lead Editor. I was also responsible for
                general SEO maintenance including best on-page practices and outreach for off-page SEO.
              </p>

              <br>

              <p>As a means to facilitate content creation, I taught myself basic HTML and CSS to code and style articles for
                the company's website. I soon became fascinated with the entire coding process from developing the original
                idea to the final working product. I learned to embrace the rollercoaster of coding. Working in this environment,
                I began to understand the painful hours spent searching for the best solutions as well as the euphoria of
                publishing a finished page I could be proud of. It was clear to me that my career path should involve coding,
                and enrolling in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp was the first step to achieve my goal.</p>

              <br>

              <p>I bring to any endeavor complete and focused dedication, the ability to work with others as part of a team,
                and a flexible mindset for achieving the success of any project.</p>
